Steps to get project up and running

1. Install Git on your local machine. You can download the installer from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. For example, if you want to clone the project to a directory called "vue-vs-next" on your desktop, you can use the following command:
   $ cd ~/Desktop

4. Clone the project by running the following command:
   $ git clone https://github.com/lyle-timotheus/vue-vs-next.git

5. Navigate into the project directory:
   $ cd vue-vs-next
   $ cd next

## Follow step 6 after this and then come back to the next line

$ cd vue

## Also install the dependencies by running the command in step 6

6. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
   $ npm install

7. Go to view the application in vue or next directory and run the following command:
   $ npm run dev

## This will start a local development server and open the project in your default web browser.
