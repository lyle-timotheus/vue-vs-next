        <span class="font-bold">Personal Points</span> While building this
        application using the 2 frameworks
      </h2>
      <h3>Next JS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All components are now server-side components, meaning the load speed
          is faster
        </li>
        <li>
          Newer loading.js file functionality to show an instant loading state
          from the server. No need to set this up in state management.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fetching of data is easily managed and easy to share across
          components.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the new update, I don't have to use getServerSideProps anymore
          since all components are server components by default.
        </li>
        <li>
          I can load fonts from Google fonts with "New @next/font" which is
          self-hosted. Big win 💪
        </li>
        <li>
          We also have async Server Components and enables component-level
          fetching.
        </li>
        <li>
          New App directory which helps with structuring of code. ⬇️

            width="600"
          />
        </li>
        <li class="cons">
          I have to specifically declare that a component is a client component
          by add 'use client' as the first line in the component file.
        </li>
        <li class="cons">
          I had to adjust quickly to the new App structure that was recently
          introduced in Next JS 13.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- VUE JS SECTION -->
      <h3>VUE JS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Files are nealty organized and easy to find.</li>

        <li>State syntax made it a bit easier to write.</li>
        <li>
          The learning curve should be easier since it has a mix of Ractive JS
          and follows a similar style.
        </li>
        <li>
          I like that the framework is very flexible and does not follow the
          opinionated practice of Next JS.
        </li>
        <li class="cons">
          Two way binding confused me at times compared to Next JS "one way
          binding".
        </li>
        <li class="cons">
          I got confused sometimes with the components I needed to add into the
          Parent file.
        </li>
        <li class="cons">
          I still have to still explicilty add life cycle hooks.
        </li>
        <li class="cons">
          I need to setup routes in the router file and attach various options
          as well.
